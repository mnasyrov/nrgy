# Overview

The library provides components for programming with reactive state and effects
using MVC/MVVM design patterns.

Core components form an efficient computation graph which includes:

- **Atom** - a state store
- **Signal** - an event emitter
- **Effect** - a subscription to Atom or Signal
- **Scope** - a sink of subscriptions

The library has tools for MVC/MVVM design pattern to program **Controller** as
business logic and **View Model** as a presentation layer independently of UI
framework.

Controllers and view models can be extended to use additional features, as
example, to use a dependency injection container.
