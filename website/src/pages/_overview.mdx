# Overview

The library provides components for programming with reactive state and effects
using MVC and MVVM-like design patterns.

Core components include Atoms (stores), Signals (event emitters), Scopes and
Effects (subscriptions), which form an efficient computation graph.

Additionally, the library includes an MVC/MVVM feature, that provides building
blocks for programming Controllers for a business layer and View Models for a
presentation layer. Controllers and view models can be extended using other
features in an optional way.

Other parts of the library include integrations with third-party tools and
frameworks. At the moment the following are supported:

- [React][link:react] - a library for creating web user interfaces
- [Ditox.js][link:ditox] - a dependency injection container and modules
- [RxJS][link:rxjs] - a reactive programming library for composing asynchronous
  or callback-based code
- [RxEffects][link:rx-effects] - the predecessor of Nrgy.js, a reactive state
  and effect management library based on RxJS

All of these integrations are optional and can be used independently.

The core and MVC components are framework-agnostic and can be used by web and
server applications, libraries and CLI tools.
